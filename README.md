![](banner.png)

To GitHub users, welcome to our repository for visualizing time series forcasting by using Python/Jupyter Notebook for making the collection of codes for using in Time Series Forecasting practices. This repository is the collaboration between Charunthon Limseelo (Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors) and Sirisa Kornnawawat (Google Developer Student Club), to train or have a practice for senior project of 4th year in Vistula University, Poland.

## Requirements

This repository is used in Python 3.11.5 in Jupyter Notebook framework with some significant libraries or packages that we need to additionally install in the code editor/PATH environment, which are:
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Tensorflow Keras
4. Sklearn (Scikit Learn)
5. Seaborn
6. Numpy

## What's inside the repository

In this repository, we include lots of practices datasets even from books or external data from UCI and Kaggle
